# .graphql extension makes it clear that it contains graphQL code

# Type Query is to READ DATA without modifying 
# NOTE - All Queries must return result/response object 
# right side of the ':' is the response object
type Query {
  # all our Query Types
  
  # an array where each item data type is a CUSTOM type 'Job'
  # array of Job Objects from below
  jobs: [Job]
}

# SCHEMA TYPES - data types
type Job {
  # graphQL provides a built in type 'ID' which is similar to STRING - sent as a string in json
  # '!' - required, never be NULL
  id: ID!
  title: String
  description: String

  # NOTE - To access data from Job to Company
  # Note - setting up Nested Queries with field - 'company'
  # Linking another data table, similar to foreign key in relational database
  company: Company
}

type Company {
  id: ID!
